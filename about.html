            <p>
                Hello, world! My name is Brandon Gautier. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computuing Science and 
                Information Technology at <a href="https://www.athabascau.ca/" title="Athabasca University Homepage">Athabasca University</a>. 
                In addition to Computing Science, I am also highly interested in the field of Psychology. In fact, I have a Bachelor's Degree (BSc) in Psychology from the
                <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/" title="University of Alberta Homepage">University of Alberta</a>. My senior 
                undergraduate project involved the use of animal models to study various neuroprotective methods against stroke. 
                I also possess a Master's Degree (MSc) in Neuropsychology from the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" title="University of Edinburgh Homepage">University of Edinburgh</a>. 
                My Master's dissertation focused on the impact of planning on multitasking abilities in young and old adults. Outside 
                of academics, I enjoy practicing the guitar, working out, and playing computer games.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="secondary-font-color">Degree</span> Progress</h2>

            <p>
                The following table will be used to document my current degree progress. I plan to update it whenever new grades become available.
            </p>
